# DSP-in-Python
This repo follows the online YouTube DSP course by Rich Radke from Rensslear Polytechnic Institute. The exapmles in the lecture are given in Matlab and I'd like to rework the examples in Python and perhhaps even work some of the homework into Python labs.

The YouTube Course is done by Rich Radke from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  And you can find it online here: [YouTube Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuh62Q4Sv7BUSzx5Jr8Wrxxn-U10qG1et)

As mentioned on the YouTube channel, the course follows the [Textbook by Proakis and Manolakis, 4th Eddition](https://a.co/d/2iMp1k1) (not an affiliate link).  Good news is that the text can be obtained used at a reasonable price online.
